1. Difference between readyState and status:
- readyState indicates the state of the XMLHttpRequest. It goes from 0 to 4, where 4 means the request is complete.
- status shows the HTTP response code from the server (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).

2. How to make the request asynchronous:
- You can make the request asynchronous by setting the third parameter of the xhr.open() method to true, like this:
  xhr.open("GET", "url", true);

3. Why asynchronous communication is recommended for web applications:
- Asynchronous communication allows the web page to continue working without waiting for the server response. This improves user experience by preventing the page from freezing or reloading.
